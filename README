How to install:

This installs like a normal plugin, but uploaded files which fail the virus check will silently fail.
To fix this by showing a message, open ojs/templates/author/submit/step2.tpl and replace line 50
onwards with this:

{else}
<tr valign="top">
	<td colspan="2" class="nodata">

{* 2011-11-21 Niall Douglas Start *}
{if $smarty.session.hasVirus}<span style="color:red;">{$smarty.session.virusScanMsg|escape}</span>{else}{translate key="author.submit.noSubmissionFile"}{/if}
{* 2011-11-21 Niall Douglas End *}

</td>
</tr>
{/if}


Obviously without ClamAV's daemon running it will refuse all files :)
